# tiddlymoon
Port of an early XUL version of the Firefox extension TiddlyFox to Pale Moon.

## What it's for

Tiddlymoon is a browser extension that allows easier saving of [TiddlyWiki Classic](https://classic.tiddlywiki.com/) personal wikis.
It does not work with the later TiddlyWiki 5.

## This version acts differently from the Firefox one . . .

Tiddlymoon was forked from version 1.0.0alpha20 of TiddlyFox.  That was the last version in the 1.0 TiddlyFox series, and the last
version that does not use Jetpack (a Firefox extension kit that is deprecated in Pale Moon).

If you remember your TiddlyFox as having a button that indicates whether the extension is active or not for a specific TiddlyWiki,
you're remembering the Jetpack-based 2.0 series.  My attempts to introduce similar functionality to this version of the extension
have not been successful thus far.

## Status of this Add-On

Effectively, it's in maintenance mode. Since I use it myself, I'll attempt to keep it functioning.  I may or may not make another
attempt to bring it up to par with TiddlyFox 2.0x

I'm happy to accept merge requests.

## History of this Add-On

Tiddlymoon was forked from [TiddlyFox](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyFox) 1.0.0alpha20 in May 2021.  That version of
TiddlyFox dates from around 2016.

TiddlyFox was the creation of Jeremy Ruston, who is not associated in any way with this fork, but deserves to be credited
for his good work.

I have retained the 2-clause BSD license associated with TiddlyFox on its old page at the Mozilla Add-ons site for Tiddlymoon.
